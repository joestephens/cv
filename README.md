I would describe myself as effervescent, friendly, enthusiastic and spontaneous, but if you needed further convincing, I've asked the Chief Joy Officer at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) how they would describe me:

> "A true enigma :crystal_ball:. The eighth wonder of the world :earth_africa:." - [Dana Svoboda](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/chiefjoyofficer)

I've recently graduated from Makers Academy. 16 weeks earlier, I embarked on a journey to learn how to learn to code. This wasn't my first foray into coding - prior to University, I dabbled with PHP as a hobby. Now - in retrospect - I see how easy it was to learn something the wrong way. Makers has taught me how to approach learning in a different way, igniting a passion inside of me to write code that is test-driven, object-orientated, and clean. 

I'm looking for a role where I can continue to learn (and be challenged), and where I have the support network available to me so that I can continue to prosper in my journey towards becoming a great developer.

## <a name="strengths">I'm...</a>
#### Resilient
In my previous role as a Payroll Officer for the NHS, staff shortages were very common, resulting in abnormally sized workloads on a daily basis. This meant it was vital that I maintained productivity whilst working longer hours, in order to meet deadlines, otherwise employees wouldn't get paid properly. Working on group projects at Makers, it was common to be up until the early morning, writing more code, in order to meet MVP. These scenarios haven't been ideal, but I'm a very upbeat person and I find it easy to bounce back and keep on going.

#### Patient
I believe it's important that everybody in my team is able to keep up, as it means everybody makes a fair contribution, making for a happier place to work. Working for the NHS, I went above and beyond to develop training materials for junior employees, and to take time out to sit down with them regularly to explain new concepts. In my time at Makers Academy, I always ensured that my pair understood what I was asking them to type, and I'd always endeavour to help others in my cohort.

#### Personable
I'm always smiling, have a great sense of humour and make it my mission to raise the spirits of those around me. I will put aside everything I'm doing to help others, and always think of myself as approachable. When working in a team, I'm willing to compromise on decisions in order to find a happy medium and maintain team unity.
